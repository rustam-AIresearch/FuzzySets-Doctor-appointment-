### Scenario :

The following scenario is a drastically simplified version of a medical scenario, but nevertheless you will need to use systematic principles and processes as involved in creating a solution for a realistic real-world scenario.
You have been asked to create a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to provide advice to family doctors that they can use to assess patients when they come in with an illness, to establish whether the patient needs to be
sent to hospital for emergency attention. In this very simple scenario, the FIS will take three inputs,Temperature, Headache and Patient-age, which will be represented as three linguistic variables, and produce
a single output, Urgency, which represents the degree of urgency (or severity) of the patient’s condition. When provided with inputs in terms of temperature (rated in degrees Celsius), severity of headache (rated
on a subjective scale from 0 to 10), and age (on a scale from 0 to 130), the system will use a set of rules to produce the output i.e. how urgent medical treatment is for the patient.
The output should be quantified in the range of 0 to 100, with 0 meaning the patient’s condition is not at all urgent (no need to go to hospital) and 100 meaning extremely urgent (rush to hospital as quickly as possible).


### Cases:

Case 1 - Where all input values are numbers (Type-1 Fuzzy Sets)
Case 2 - Where all input values are intervals (Type-2 Fuzzy Sets)
